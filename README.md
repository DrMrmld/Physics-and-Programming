# Description

These are the programs I coded as part of the Physics and Programming club at school. Assignments are taken from [this repository](https://github.com/danielct/High-School-Computational-Physics-Workshop). Apart from the assignments on Computational Physics, you can find Data Science and other 'projects' in this repository.

# Plots

Here are some plots of the programs I've written from this repository. Other images of the plots and the code can be found in the corresponding folders.
